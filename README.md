# Chatbot-Instructions

Week 12 Dialogflow Chatbot.

Inside the AiBot workspace , under the section apps add the app rocketelevatorbot. 

You can then access the app and use the following commands to get the desired results.

**To receive the brief to answer the first half of the chatbot assignment by typing one of the following:** 

``` 
"i need the information now"
"the summary, please"
"brief"
"Hello! I would like the summary"
"Hello! I would like the brief"
"i want to know the situation"
"what does the situation look like?"
"give me the brief"
 ```

 **To check on a status of a particular elevator type in the chatbot the following:**

``` 
"What is the status of elevator X?"
WHERE X = Desired elevator id.
 ```

**BONUS**
**You can also request the status for the column and the battery simply replace the elevator with the desired controller battery, column or elevator.**


``` 
"What is the status of XYZ X?"
WHERE X = Desired elevator id.
WHERE XYZ = Desired controller.
 ```

**BONUS**
**Those utilized get calls, in this chatbot we have implemented PUT calls as well. You can check the status of each of the controllers but you can also change the status for all of them.
Type in one of the following to test:**

``` 
change the status of elevator 111 to inactive
change the status of column 55 to active
change the status of battery 1 to intervention
 ```

 **Trouble Shooting**
 Once in a while for some reason the bot doesnt respond right away. If after typing in one of the previous sentences you do not get a respond please try again. Make sure your spelling matches because I noticed it is picky regarding the spelling and punctuation, so check those.
